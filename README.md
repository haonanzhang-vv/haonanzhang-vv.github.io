title: "About Me"
---

I am Haonan Zhang, 4th year PhD Candidate in Quantitative Marketing at University of Washington, Foster School of Business. My primary research lies in consumer shopping behaviors in multichannel retailing, with a particular focus on how the adoption of online shopping affects consumers’ offline shopping. I investigate the cross-channel spillover effects of online adoption and their implications for retailers’ pricing strategies and profitability. 

In addition, I am interested in digital marketing, recommender systems, and personalization on online platforms such as e-commerce and grocery delivery. 

My research methodologies include structural models, causal inference, machine learning, and field experiments.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Shirsho Biswas and Prof. Hema Yoganarasimhan. I am on the 2025–26 academic job market.
