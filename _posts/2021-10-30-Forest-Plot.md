# 1. Format of dataset for forest plot
We will use __ggplot2__ to make a __forest plot__ for estimated odds ratios from logistic regression models and the ggplot2 requires a specific format of the dataset. __We require three packages `ggplot2`, `gridExtra`, and `scales`.__ In this dataset, we have 6 columns

- `Variable`: __covariates__ in logistic regression models (numerical);

- `Time`: time points on month for different outcomes (numerical);

- `OR`: estimated __odds ratios__ for `Variable` (numerical);

- `Lower` and `Upper`: lower and upper bounds in __95% confidence intervals__ for estimated odds ratios (numerical);

- `Summary`: __sentences__ combined OR and 95% CI for odds ratios (string);

- `Index`: it is a sequence of ordered number used for the plot and its length is equal to the number of `Variable`.

In the ggplot, no matter what kind of plots we make, they are basically composed of two parts: X-axis and Y-axis. __Since we want to create a forest plot for odds ratio, we set X-axis as__ `Variable` __and Y-axis as__ `OR`.

# 2. Version 0.0
When we determined which variables should be placed in X-axis or Y-axis, we then need to choose what "values" should be displayed. Typically, these "values" are in numerical format and we also need to choose what types of plots we want to show (e.g. point, line, bar, tile, box with whisker, etc.). A forest plot consists of a center (`OR`) and two whiskers (`Lower` and `Upper`).

```{r}
# Version 0.0
ggplot(Plot.OR.Mat.6, aes(x = OR, y = Variable)) +    # x is for X-axis | y is for Y-axis                  
  geom_point() +                                      # a function for plotting points
  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = Lower, xmax = Upper))     # a function for plotting two whiskers
```


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YzwIsALaity/Forest-Plot-Tutorial-in-R/33ff981aaeb260a5f32916e05fa769b35aadf931/Version%200.0.jpeg)

So it basically looks like the above one. But we can polish it and eventually attach `Summary` with corresponding `Variable`. 

# 3. Version 1.0
The main elements in this plot are from two functions: 

- `geom_point()`: this function is for points (OR in our example) and it can use different commands to modify the point (e.g. __shape__ [`shape = 18`], __size__ [`size = 3`], __color__ [`col = 'black'`], etc.);

- `geom_errorbarh()`: this function for horizontal error bars which are two whiskers in a 95% confidence interval and it requires providing __minimum and maximum for the "value"__ that we want to pass into (e.g. `geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = Lower, xmax = Upper))`). We also can change the length of the __vertical tick__ on two sides (e.g. `height = 0.25`).

Meanwhile, plots for odds ratio are often displayed under log scale and we can also easily change the scale system in ggplot with the command `scale_x_continuous()` (numerical value are in X-axis) or `scale_y_continuous()` (numerical value are in y-axis). In our example, the numerical values are in X-axis so we use 

- `scale_x_continuous()`: we use the command `trans = 'log'` (for __log transformation__) inside the function and set up the __scale range of X-axis__ with the command `limits = c(0.005, 13)`(lower, upper). Since the log transformation will bring up lots of digits for numerical values, we can pass the `label_number()` to round digits into __2 decimal places of precision__.

We can combine them with the __X-axis label__ [`xlab()`] and the __main title__ [`ggtitle()`] to see what it looks like.

```{r}
# Version 1.0
ggplot(Plot.OR.Mat.6, aes(x = OR, y = Variable)) +                  # x is for X-axis | y is for Y-axis                  
  geom_point(shape = 18, size = 3) +                                # a function for plotting points
  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = Lower, xmax = Upper),                   # a function for plotting two whiskers
                 height = 0.25) +                                   # the length of vertical ticks 
  scale_x_continuous(trans = 'log',                                 # log transformation for values in X-axis
                     limits = c(0.005, 13),                         # range of X-axis in original scale
                     labels = label_number()) +                     # round digits
  xlab("Odds Ratio (95% CI, log scale)") +                          # X-axis label
  ggtitle('6-month Timepoint')                                      # title of plots
```

In the Version 1.0, we can find that the gray background and grid may not be good for presenting the plot and texts in two axes are small. 

# 3. Version 2.0
So in the next step we are going to improve the background and texts under the Version 1.0 and we are going to introduce some functions and corresponding commands.

- `theme_bw()`: this is a dark-on-light theme and better for presentations.

- `theme()`: this is a general function for all non-data components in a plot so we can use it to modify any texts, labels, backgrounds, etc. Within this function, we are going to introduce some commands.
  
  + `panel.border`, `panel.background`, `panel.grid.major`, and `panel.grid.minor`: these four are used to __control the background and gird of a plot__. since we want to give it a blank      background and grid, we will set
  
    `panel.border = element_blank(),`\
    `panel.background = element_blank(),`\
    `panel.grid.major = element_blank(),`\
    `panel.grid.minor = element_blank()`.
    
    In here, the function `element_blank()` is to __display nothing for non-data elements__.
    
  + `axis.line.x` and `axis.line.y`: they are used to __control the axis line__ in X-axis and Y-axis. In the forest plot, the axis line for Y-axis is blank so we will set
  
    `axis.line.y = element_blank()`.

  + `axis.ticks.x` and `axis.ticks.y`: they are used to __control the small tick__ in X-axis and Y-axis. In the forest plot, the ticks for X-axis and Y-axis are blank so we will set
  
    `axis.line.y = element_blank(),`\
    `axis.line.y = element_blank()`.
  
  + `axis.text.x` and `axis.text.y`: they are used to __modify texts in two axes__. Since we want to enlarge the font of texts in Y-axis so we will set
  
    `axis.text.y = element_text(colour = "black", size = 11)`.
    
    The function `element_text()` is to __modify texts__ in a plot and it provides a brunch of commands for font size, color, position, face, etc. 
  
  + `plot.title`: this is to __modify the title__. We want to align the title on the left side and make the font to be bold, so we will set
  
    `plot.title = element_text(hjust = -0.86, face="bold")`.

We also want to move the title for Y-axis and add a vertical line for OR = 1 (`geom_vline(xintercept = 1, color = "red", linetype = "dashed", cex = 0.5, alpha = 0.5)`). Now we can combine them all together!

             color = "red",                                         # the color of line
             linetype = "dashed",                                   # the type of line
                                                                    # we used dashed line in here

This version looks more clear and tidy! We can try our last step, that is to combine the `Summary` for each variable. 

# 4. Version 3.0
In the last version, we are going to combine the `Summary` and the main plot together. The basic logic of the combination is to put two plots together--the main plot is the Version 2.0 and another empty plot only contains `Summary`. First, we are going to create an empty plot which __attaches__ `Summary` __on its right hand side__. We first create an empty plot.

```{r}
table_base <- 
  ggplot(Plot.OR.Mat.6, aes(y = Variable)) +                          # everything in this plot is empty 
  ylab(NULL) + xlab('') + ggtitle('') + 
  xlim(0, 13) +                                                       # make sure this is the same as p1
  theme(panel.border = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), 
        axis.line.x = element_blank(),
        axis.line.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(color = "white", hjust = -3, size = 11),
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = -0.86, face = "bold"))      # make sure hjust is the same as p1
## OR point estimate table
tab1 <- table_base + geom_text(aes(y = rev(Index), x = 1, label = Summary), size = 4, hjust = 0, vjust = -0.5)  
```

The `tab1` is an empty plot only including `Summary` and we need to arrange its position and combine it with the main plot `p1`. Hence, we need to use the function `grid.arrange()`.

- `grid.arrange()`: we will put the main plot `p1` first and then `tab1`. The commands, `nrow` and `ncol`, are used to arrange positions of two plots. We will set 
  `nrow = 1` and `ncol = 2` which means we want to horizontally put them together where `p1` is in the left hand side and `tab1` is in the right hand side.

Eventually, the final plot will be better than previous versions.

```{r}
# eventually we attach the summary to the plot
grid.arrange(p1, tab1, 
             nrow = 1, ncol = 2)
```

This is the final version! If we want to print it out from R, __we can always change its size when we save the figure to make sure title is center or aligned left__. 

# 5. Version 4.0
This is a stacked version of forest plots. __However, this time we need to remove everything in the X-axis for the plot at the top of a stack__. 

```{r}
# Version 4.0
p2 <- 
ggplot(Plot.OR.Mat.6, aes(x = OR, y = Variable)) +                  # x is for X-axis | y is for Y-axis

        plot.title = element_text(hjust = -0.065, face = "bold")) +  # the main title

  xlim(0, 13) +                                                       # make sure this is the same as p1

        plot.title = element_text(hjust = -0.065, face = "bold"))      # make sure hjust is the same as p1

## OR point estimate table
tab2 <- table_base2 + geom_text(aes(y = Index, x = 1, label = Summary), size = 4, hjust = 0, vjust = 1.35)  
# eventually we attach all together!
grid.arrange(p2, tab2,
             p1, tab1,
             nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
```

__After we remove the X-axis for the top plot__, we need to __align the__ `Summary` __with rows in the plot__ and this can be modified by `geom_text(aes(y = Index, x = 1, label = Summary), size = 4, hjust = 0, vjust = 1.35)` (need to modify `vjust = `: modify vertical distance).
