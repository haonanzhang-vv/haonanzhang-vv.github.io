This is a short tutorial for creating a __radar chart/spider chart/star chart__ and it requires `fmsb` and `scales` packages. A radar chart is a good tool for visualizing multivariate data that is shared among similar groups/participants so it is good to visualize life performance metrics (e.g. EQ-5D-5L, EQ-5D-3L, etc.). We will take a dataset with __EQ-5D-5L__ as an example in this tutorial. 

The EQ-5D-5L is a health-related quality of life measurement and it includes __five dimensions: mobility (MO), self-care (SC), usual activities (UA), pain/discomfort (PD), and anxiety/depression (AD)__. For each dimension, it has five ordinal levels:

- 1: no problem;

- 2: slight;

- 3: moderate;

- 4: severe;

- 5: extreme.

Each participant in the dataset will provide scores for five dimensions. 

## 1. Format of dataset
The original dataset has seven columns:

- `PTID`: an __unique participant's identification__ (string);

- `MO`, `SC`, `UA`, `PD`, and `AD`: __scores__ for five dimensions (numerical);

- `Group`: groups that participants are belonged to [four groups: __Healthy Control, Infected Patients, Long-term Symptoms, Short-term Symptoms__].

In the radar chart, we want to __show average levels of five dimensions for four groups__ so we need to do data preprocessing first. We will `dplyr` and `tidyr` packages for this process.

```{r}
# Create a table with averages for each measurement
Dt.Summary <- 
  Dt %>% 
  group_by(Group) %>% 
  summarise(UA.Avg = mean(UA),
            SC.Avg = mean(SC),
            AD.Avg = mean(AD),
            PD.Avg = mean(PD),
            MO.Avg = mean(MO))
kable(Dt.Summary)
```

After data preprocessing, the dataset used for creating a radar chart will only include mean scores of five dimensions for different groups. However, the required format of the dataset for radar chart, using the function in `fmsb` package, need to __attach two rows at the top of the above dataset--one is for minimum score and another is for maximum score__.

The above one is the __final dataset__ that we are going to use for creating a radar chart.

## 2. Single radar plot
We first create a single radar chart with the final dataset and are going to use the `radarchart()` function. So we will introduce some useful commands within the main function:

- `axistype`: this is used to choose the __type of axes__ and its default is 0.
  * `axistype = 1` = center axis label
  * `axistype = 2` = around-the-chart label 
  * `axistype = 3` = both center and around-the-chart (peripheral) labels
  * `axistype = 4` = center axis label with two-digit number
  * `axistype = 5` = both center and around-the-chart (peripheral) labels with two-digit number
  
- `pcol`: this is a __vector/number of color codes for plot data__.

- `pfcol`: this is a __vector/number of color codes for filling polygons__.

- `plwd`: this is a __vector/number of line widths for plot data__.

- `plty`: this is a __vector/number of line types for plot data__.

- `cglcol`: this is used to choose __line color__ for radar grids.

- `cglty`: this is used to choose __line type__ for radar grids.

- `cglwd`: this is used to choose __line width__ for radar grids.

- `axislabcol`: this is used to choose __color of axis label and numbers__.

- `vlabels`: this is a __character vector for the names for variables__.

- `vlcex`: this is to choose __font size magnification for__ `vlabels`.

```{r}
# the name of each group used in legend ####################################################################
Group <- c('Healthy Control', 'Infected Patients', 'Long-term Symptoms', 'Short-term Symptoms')

# the choice of color for each group #######################################################################
ColorOfGroup <- c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800", "#FC4E07", 'gray')

# the name of each vertex ################################################################################## 
EQ5D5L <- c('Usual\nActivities', 'Self-care', 'Anxiety/\nDepression', 'Pain/\nDiscomfort', 'Mobility')

# Plot ######################################################################################################
# op is used to control the margin of radar chart
op <- par(mar = c(1,2,2,2))
# the main function for figure and choices of parameters
radarchart(
    df = Dt.Summary.2[, 2:6], axistype = 1,
    # Customize the polygon
    pcol = ColorOfGroup, 
    pfcol = alpha(ColorOfGroup, 0.1),  # alpha() is used to control the transparency of color
    plwd = 2, plty = 1,
    # Customize the grid
    cglcol = "black", cglty = 1, cglwd = 0.8,
    # Customize the axis
    axislabcol = "black", caxislabels = 1:5,  calcex = 0.7,
    # Variable labels
    vlcex = 1.25, vlabels = EQ5D5L
  )
# Add an horizontal legend
legend("right",        # we put the legend on the right of the radar chart but one can also put
                       # it at the bottom of the figure with the command ["bottom", horiz = TRUE]
       legend = Group,     # set up the text for legend
       col = ColorOfGroup, # corresponding colors for groups
       text.col = "black", cex = 1.25, pt.cex = 1.25, bty = "n", pch = 20
  )
par(op) # this command is used to perform the setup of margin for radar chart
```

Since the `radarchart()` is based on the basic `plot()` in the R, __all non-data components (e.g. point, line, text, color, etc.) follow the guidance of__ `plot()`. This means parameter choices for `pcol`,  `pfcol`, `cglcol`, ..... follow the guidance of `plot()`.

## 3. Multiple radar charts
In the next step, we are going to put multiple radar charts together if they all share the same legend. This is one is a little bit complex than the single one but it is still acceptable. __The basic logic for putting multiple radar charts in a row is first to create different radar charts separately and then attach an empty plot including the legend only to a row of radar plots.__ 

```{r}
# arrange positions for multiple radar charts and legends ###################################################
par(mfrow = c(1, 3)) # mfrow = c(1,3) means we want to put plots/legends in 1 row and each plot/legend
                     # occupies 1 column so totally 3 columns (2 radar charts + 1 legend) 
# op is used to control the margin of radar chart ###########################################################
op <- par(mar = c(1,2,2,1)) # OK to omit this one

# First radar chart ######################################################################################### 
radarchart(
    df = Dt.Summary.2[, 2:6], axistype = 1,
    # Customize the polygon
    pcol = color, pfcol = alpha(color, 0.1), plwd = 2, plty = 1,
    # Customize the grid
    cglcol = "black", cglty = 1, cglwd = 0.8,
    # Customize the axis
    axislabcol = "black", 
    # Variable labels
    vlcex = 1.35, vlabels = EQ5D5L,
    caxislabels = 1:5, calcex = 0.7
  )

# Second radar chart ######################################################################################### 
radarchart(
    df = Dt.Summary.2[, 2:6], axistype = 1,
    # Customize the polygon
    pcol = color, pfcol = alpha(color, 0.1), plwd = 2, plty = 1,
    # Customize the grid
    cglcol = "black", cglty = 1, cglwd = 0.8,
    # Customize the axis
    axislabcol = "black", 
    # Variable labels
    vlcex = 1.35, vlabels = EQ5D5L,
    caxislabels = 1:5, calcex = 0.7
  )

# Add an horizontal legend ###################################################################################
# control the margin of radar chart and OK to omit it
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0)) 
# Create empty plot 
plot(1, type = "n", axes = FALSE, xlab = "", ylab = "") 
# Attach the legend to the empty plot
legend('left',  # this 'left' means we want to put the legend on the left side of the empty plot
                # and this is close to the 2 radar charts
       legend = c('Healthy Control', 'Infected Patients', 'Long-term Symptoms', 'Short-term Symptoms'),
       col = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800", "#FC4E07", 'gray'),
       pch = 20, cex = 1.35, pt.cex = 1.35, bty = "n")

par(op)
```

The above is the final version of radar charts and similar to other plots in R, the final size and resolution of the figure can be adjusted when you are going to output it from R. Since the `radarchart()` in `fmsb` package is based on the basic `plot()` function in R, it provides users more flexible way to make choices for non-data components (e.g. legends, texts, colors, etc.).
