This is a short tutorial for creating __alluvium plots in R__ with `ggplot2`. An alluvium plot is used to show the change/trend/development of subjects regarding single/multiple variables over time flow. Beside `ggplot2`, we require to use `ggalluvial` package in our plots and will provide two examples of alluvium plots.

## 1. Example: Counts of specialists in different timepoints
The first dataset we used is a follow-up study with a __cohort of 200 patients__. They reported what types of specialists they sought for at __4 different timepoints of visits (repeated measure)__. Hence the dataset has three columns:

- `PTID`: __unique identification__ for each patient (200 participants, string);

- `Time`: this covariate provides different __timepoints of visits__ and has __four levels [Acute, 6-month, 12-month, 24-month]__ (string);

- `Specialist`: this covariate provides different __types of specialists__ and has __five levels [None, Neurology, Rheumatology, Infectious Disease, Pulmonology]__ (numerical).

There are some new functions we are going to use for creating a alluvium plot beside the `ggplot()`. __In `ggplot()`, we first set up the X-axis as `x = Time` and fill out stratum with its color as `stratum = Specialist, fill = Specialist`. Since each participant's choice of specialist are changed and recorded over `Time`, the alluvium in the plot should each unique participant and we will set `alluvium = PTID`. Eventually, we set the legend label as `label = Specialist`.__

- `geom_flow()`: this function is used to create __lodes__ of an alluvial plot.
  * In this example, __lodes__ are just flow curves in the plot. If we just single call this function, it looks like below

```{r}
# Set time as a factor
Dt$Time <- factor(Dt$Time, levels = c('Acute', '6-month', '12-month', '24-month'))
# Plot
ggplot(Dt, aes(x = Time, stratum = Specialist, alluvium = PTID, fill = Specialist, label = Specialist)) +
  geom_flow(stat = "alluvium") 
```

- `geom_stratum()`: this function is used to create __strata__ of an alluvial plot.
  * In this example, each __stratum__ represents the amount of participants seeking for a type of specialists.

```{r}
ggplot(Dt, aes(x = Time, stratum = Specialist, alluvium = PTID, fill = Specialist, label = Specialist)) +
  geom_stratum(alpha = 0.7) # "alpha = 0.7" is used to control the transparency of color filled in strata
```

- `scale_fill_brewer()`: this function is used to provide sequential ('seq'), diverging ('div') and qualitative ('qual') __color schemes__ in `ggplot2`.
  * `type = 'div'` means we want diverging color scheme (colors are different from each other apparently) and `palette = "Set2"` means we want to use the "Set2" palette.

We can combine together to see what we can get! This time we are going to remove the background and grid and __use "Times New Roman" font for every text/label__ in the plot (`element_text(family = 'Times')`). 

```{r}
# Version 1.0
ggplot(Dt, aes(x = Time, 
               stratum = Specialist, 
               alluvium = PTID, 
               fill = Specialist, 
               label = Specialist)) +
  geom_flow(stat = "alluvium") + 
  geom_stratum(alpha = 0.7) + 
  xlab('Visit Timepoint') + ylab('Count') + 
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "div", palette = "Set2") + 
  theme_bw() +                                                      
  theme(panel.border = element_blank(),                             
        panel.background = element_blank(),                    
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), 
        axis.line.x = element_line(),                               
        axis.line.y = element_line(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(colour = "black", size = 11, family = "Times"),    
        axis.text.y = element_text(colour = "black", size = 11, family = "Times"),
        axis.ticks.x = element_line(),                              
        axis.ticks.y = element_line(),
        axis.title.x = element_text(colour = "black", face = "bold",size = 11, family = "Times"),                               
        axis.title.y = element_text(colour = "black", face = "bold",size = 11, family = "Times"),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 11, color = 'black',family = "Times"),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 13, face = "bold", color = 'black', family = "Times"),
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", family = "Times"))
```

The height of each stratum is the number of participants at a given timepoint of visit with a type of specialist and flow curves between two timepoints show the longitudinal changes in specialists for participants. The acute state is the baseline and we have 200 participants. In subsequent follow-ups, we lost some participants and this is reflected by the height of bars in following timepoints. 

## 2. Example 2: Counts of viruses in different timepoints
The second dataset is a 2-year record of counts for different respiratory viruses in a given region. Counts of different viruses are collected quarterly from 2019 to 2020. It has three columns:

- `Virus`: types of respiratory viruses [5 viruses: Rhinovirus, Seasonal Coronavirus, Adenovirus, Human Metapneumovirus, Parainfluenza] (string);

- `Time`: calendar times in the format Year-Month [6 timepoints: 2019-3, 2019-6, 2019-9, 2019-12, 2020-3, 2020-6, 2020-9, 2020-12] (string);

- `Count`: the number of viruses (numerical).

Differed from the example one which has __stratum__ inside a bar for each timepoint, this example will only have alluvium and flow. Therefore, we will use new functions.

- `geom_alluvium()`: this function is used to combine __lodes__ from `geom_flow()` and __strata__ from `geom_stratum()` and output them together as __ribbon        curves__.
  * Since we want to show longitudinal changes of viral counts, we need to pass `aes(fill = Virus, colour = Virus)` where `fill` and `colour` will be specific to     each viruses. 
  * `alpha = 0.7` is used to control the transparency of colors and `decreasing = FALSE` means that __a virus with more counts will be always placed at the top      position regarding a given timepoint__.

- `scale_fill_brewer()`: this is the same as `scale_color_brewer()` 

Meanwhile, we will pass `aes(x = Time, y = Count, alluvium = Virus)` into `ggplot()` so we set __`Time` in X-axis and `Count` in Y-axis and the `alluvium` will be `Virus`__. Let us put all together to see what we can get!

```{r}
# Set the Time as a factor 
Dt2$Time <- factor(Dt2$Time, levels = c(paste0(2019, '-', c(3,6,9,12)), paste0(2020, '-', c(3,6,9,12))))
# Version 2.0
ggplot(data = Dt2,
       aes(x = Time, 
           y = Count, 
           alluvium = Virus)) +
  geom_alluvium(aes(fill = Virus, colour = Virus),
                alpha = 0.7, decreasing = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual", palette = "Set3") +
  scale_color_brewer(type = "qual", palette = "Set3") +
  theme_bw() +                                                      
  theme(panel.border = element_blank(),                             
        panel.background = element_blank(),                    
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), 
        axis.line.x = element_line(),                              
        axis.line.y = element_line(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(colour = "black", size = 11, family = "Times", angle = -45),
        axis.text.y = element_text(colour = "black", size = 11, family = "Times"),
        axis.ticks.x = element_line(),                            
        axis.ticks.y = element_line(),
        axis.title.x = element_text(colour = "black", face = "bold", size = 11, family = "Times", vjust = -2),                               
        axis.title.y = element_text(colour = "black", face = "bold",size = 11, family = "Times"),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 11, color = 'black', family = "Times"),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 13, face = "bold", color = 'black', family = "Times"),
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", family = "Times"))
```

We eventually get a alluvium plot with colorful ribbons!
