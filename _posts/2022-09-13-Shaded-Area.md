In this tutorial, we will go through __different types of plots with shaded areas in R with `ggplot2`__ and how we can __integrate a shaded area plot with other elements (i.e., bar plot)__. The shaded area plot can help us to better understand how different types of rate/prevalence/incidence/frequency/... change over time.

## 1. Format of dataset
The dataset we used for the tutorial is a public dataset from [Seattle Flu Study](https://seattleflu.org/pathogens). After some basic data cleaning, we only keep 6 coloumns:

- `Epi.Week`: this is an __epidemiological week__, a standardized method of counting weeks to allow for the comparison of data year after year __[36 unique epi weeks]__ (string); 

- `Date`: this is the __calendar time__ (Month-Year) (string);

- `Count`: this is the __frequency of detected respiratory pathogens__ during each `Date` period (numerical); 

- `Prevalence`: this is the __proportion of persons who have been detected respiratory pathogens__ during each `Date` period (numerical); 

- `Virus`: this is the __label for a type of viral infection__ __[8 viruses: 'RSV', 'Flu', 'Adenovirus', 'Enterovirus', 'Human Coronavirus', 'Human Parainfluenza', 'Human Metapneumovirus', 'Rhinovirus']__(string);

- `Index`: this is a variable used to __indicate the order of calendar time__ (numerical).

## 2. Shaded area plot
The basic functions in `ggplot2` for shaded area plots are `geom_ribbon()` and `geom_area()` and we are going to introduce two functions:

- `geom_ribbon()`: this is used to display a interval of `y` at a given `x` and it is defined by `ymin` and `ymax` within `aes(ymin, ymax)`;

- `geom_area()`: this is a special case of `geom_ribbon()` since it sets `ymin = 0`.

The first version we want to show is for the stacked "shaded area". The x-axis will be the calendar time (`Date`), the y-axis will be the frequency of detected respiratory pathogens (`Count`), and "shaded area" for each type of `Virus` will be stacked vertically. We will use the `geom_area()` in this example and use and we will a extra package `ggthemes` for color palette.

```{r}
# Version 1: stacked
ggplot(Dt, aes(x = Index)) +                      # set up x-axis as numerical Index
  geom_area(aes(y = Count,                        # pass Count for y axis
                fill = Virus)) +                  # fill = Virus to set up different colors for viruses
  scale_x_continuous(labels = unique(Dt$Date),    # set up x-axis label as unique calendar time 
                     breaks = unique(Dt$Index)) + 
  ylab('Frequency of Detected Virus') + xlab('Calendar Time (Year-Month)') + 
  scale_fill_tableau("Tableau 10") +              # we will use the color palette from Tableau
  theme_bw() +                                                      # dark-on-light theme
  theme(panel.border = element_blank(),                             # these three are for the background and grid
        panel.background = element_blank(),                    
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
        axis.line.x = element_line(),                               
        axis.line.y = element_line(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(colour = "black", size = 11,     # rotate text in x axis 45 degrees and move 
                                   angle = 45, hjust = 1),          # text to the left side for 1 unit 
        axis.text.y = element_text(colour = "black", size = 11),
        axis.ticks.x = element_line(),                              
        axis.ticks.y = element_line(),
        axis.title.x = element_text(colour = "black", size = 11, face = 'bold', vjust = -1),                              
        axis.title.y = element_text(colour = "black", size = 11, face = 'bold'),
        legend.title = element_text(colour = "black", size = 11, face = 'bold'))  
```

In the above example, the frequency of detected virus is stacked vertically at each time point and the "shaded area" for each type of virus will be marked by a specific color (color palette is similar to __Tableau__). The next example is to integrate "shaded area" with a bar plot and we set "shaded area" for prevalence of detected viruses and bar for frequency of detected viruses. To simplify the figure, we will focus on the __prevalence and frequency of Adenovirus and Enterovirus__ to demonstrate the use of `geom_ribbon()`. Since the units of frequency and prevalence are different, we will implement the __second y axis__ in the plot to distinguish values for frequency and prevalence.

```{r}
# Extract records for Adenovirus and Enterovirus
Dt.Sub <- Dt[which(Dt$Virus %in% c('Adenovirus', 'Enterovirus')), ]
# Check distribution of Count and Prevalence
summary(Dt.Sub[, c('Count', 'Prevalence')])
```

In `ggplot2`, the __second y axis__ need to be tranformed from the __main y axis__ and we therefore need to check ranges of `Count` and `Prevalence`. We will set up `Count` as the __main y axis__ and transform the scale of `Prevalence` to match the scale of `Count` and we need to pass this process into `geom_ribbon()` and `scale_y_continuous()`:

- `geom_ribbon()`: this function requires passing `ymin` and `ymax` into `aes()` [`geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = 0, ymax = Prevalence * 325 / 0.11))`: __max of `Count` is 325 and max of `Prevalence` is 0.11__];

- `scale_y_continuous()`: this function is used to modify the __second y axis__ through the argument `sec.axis = ` and the function `sec_axis()` [`scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . * 0.11/325, name = 'Prevalence'))`]

  + `sec_axis()`: it is used to specify the __second y axis__ and `~.` can pass the scale of __main y axis__ with the transform function (`~ . * 0.11 / 325`).

Noticed that __frequency and prevalence of virus__ come with different labels so we will create two types of labels for them and the below code trunk is used to create labels.

```{r}
# Create labels for 'Count' and 'Prevalence' 
Dt.Sub$Virus_Label <- factor(ifelse(Dt.Sub$Virus == 'Adenovirus', 'Diagnoses, Adenovirus', 'Diagnoses, Enterovirus'), 
                             levels = c('Diagnoses, Adenovirus', 'Diagnoses, Enterovirus'))
Dt.Sub$Axis_Label <- factor(ifelse(Dt.Sub$Virus == 'Adenovirus', 'Prevalence, Adenovirus', 'Prevalence, Enterovirus'), 
                            levels = c('Prevalence, Adenovirus', 'Prevalence, Enterovirus'))
```

After we set up all preprocessing for the subdataset, we are going to integrate a bar plot for frequency of detected viruses with "shaded areas" for prevalence of viruses.

```{r}
# Version 2: bar + shaded area
## preselected color for different labels
Col <- c('gold2', 'purple', 'green4', 'plum3')
## figure
ggplot(Dt.Sub, aes(x = Index)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(y = Count, fill = Virus_Label), stat = 'identity', position = position_dodge()) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(x = Index, 
                  ymin = 0, ymax = Prevalence * 325 / 0.11, 
                  fill = Axis_Label)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . * 0.11/325, name = 'Prevalence')) + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = unique(Dt$Date),                      # set up x-axis label as unique calendar time 
                     breaks = unique(Dt$Index)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(Col[1:2], alpha(Col[3], 0.3), alpha(Col[4], 0.6))) + 
  ylab('No. of Cases') + xlab('Calendar Time (Year-Month)') + 
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "")) + 
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.line.x = element_line(),                               # these two are for the axis line
        axis.line.y = element_line(),
        axis.title.x = element_text(color = 'black', face = "bold"),
        axis.title.y = element_text(color = 'black', face = "bold"),
        axis.text.x = element_text(color = 'black', face = "bold", angle = 45, hjust = 1),
        axis.text.y = element_text(color = 'black', face = "bold"),
        legend.text = element_text(color = 'black', face = "bold"),
        legend.title = element_text(face = "bold", color = 'black'),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", color = 'black'))
```
