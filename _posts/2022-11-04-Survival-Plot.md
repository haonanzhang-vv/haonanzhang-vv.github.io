In this tutorial, we will go through **survival curves (e.g. Kaplan-Meier curve, Cox model curve)** with an extension package **`survminer`** from **`ggplots`**.

## 1. Format of dataset
The dataset used for the tutorial includes follow-up time for patients with a specific type of cancer and their corresponding endpoint for the last follow-up visits. It includes clinical variables for patients as well. The detail is listed below:

-   `PTID`: this is an **unique identification** for each participants **[102345 participants]** (string);

-   `Stage`: this is the **stage of cancer** where participants visited **[4 levels: 'Stage I', 'Stage II', 'Stage III', 'Stage IV']** (string);

-   `Time`: this is the **last follow-up/right-censored time** for each patient (numerical);

-   `Histology`: this is the **types of microscopic anatomy [6 types: 'Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Adenocarcinoma', 'Unknown', 'Unspecified Carcinoma', 'Other', 'Sarcoma']** (string);

-   `Treatment`: this is the **types of treatments that patients took [4 levels: 'Group 1', 'Group 2', 'Group 3', 'Group 4']** (string);

## 2. Kaplan-Meier Curve
## (1). Version 1: Basic
We will draw a basic version of Kaplan-Meier curve with the aim of **`survminer`**. We first need to fit a **Kaplan-Meier estimator** for the cancer `Stage` variable and this will **require `survival` package**. In here, we will implement the following functions:

-   `Surv(Time, Status)`: this function is used to create survival subject in R and it requires two main arguments--follow-up time (`time = Time`)/repeated measurement of time (`time = start, time2 = end`) and the event indicator (`event = Status`).
-   `survfit()`: this function is used to fit a Kaplan-Meier curve with an survival subject input.

```{r}
# Fit a Kaplan-Meier curve for cancer stage
KM <- survfit(Surv(Time, Status) ~ Stage, data = Dt.Plot)
```

After we have a Kaplan-Meier estimator, we can plug into **the main function for our plot `ggsurvplot()`**. There are several arguments for the function and we are going to introduce them:

-   `fit =`: it is used to plug in a survival estimator (e.g. output from `survfit(Surv(time, time2, event))`);

-   `data =`: we need to use the same dataset as the Kaplan-Meier estimator;

-   `pval = T`: it is used to **show p-value** for the log rank test for the comparison between different strata (at least $\geq 2$);

-   `pval.size = 4`: it is used to control **the size of the font for p-value** display;

-   `pval.coord =`: it is used to control **the location of p-value** display and it should be corresponding to the X and Y axes in the plot (e.g. `c(X.loc, Y.loc)`);

-   `legend =`: it is used to control **the location of legend** and it provides five choices ("top", "bottom", "left", "right", "none" [do not show legend]);

-   `surv.median.line =` it is a character vector for **drawing a horizontal/vertical line at median survival** and provides four choices ("hv", "h", "v", "none" [do not show median survival]).

```{r}
# Basic: survical curve with ggplot
ggsurvplot(fit = KM, data = Dt.Plot,   # Kaplan-Meier estimator and dataset               
           pval = T,                   # show p-value
           pval.size = 4,              # font size of p-value
           pval.coord = c(175, 1.0),   # coordination of p-value (x, y)
           legend = 'right',           # location of legend
           surv.median.line = 'hv')    # show median survival line 
```

Since the sample size of the dataset is large, the Keplan-Meier curves look smooth and log-rank test shows significance for difference in trends among stages.

## (2). Version 2: Facet plot
The second version is to draw a multipanel survival plot. We want to stratify the Kaplan-Meier curve into different combinations of treatments and stages so we create another Kaplan-Meier estimator stratified by both `Treatment` and `Stage`. We also introduce two other arguments for this version:

-   `facet.by =`: it indicates a categorical variable (the name of variable) that you use to **create multi-panel for survival plots**;

    +   It also accepts a character vector with length 2 (i.e., `c('Treatment', 'Stage')`);
    
-   `legend.labs =`: this is a character vector used to create a new labels for the legend and it has to be the same length as the initial legend.

```{r}
KM2 <- survfit(Surv(Time, Status) ~ Stage + Treatment, data = Dt.Plot)
ggsurvplot(KM2, data = Dt.Plot, 
           facet.by = 'Treatment',                                          # create multipanel used variable "Treatment"
           pval = TRUE, 
           legend = 'right', 
           legend.labs = c('Stage I', 'Stage II', 'Stage III', 'Stage IV')) # create a self-defined legend label
```

We can a 2-by-2 multi-panel survival plot, grouped by `Treatment` and in each panel, it is stratified by cancer `Stage`. Tests on trends are performed for each panel as well. In the next version, we are going to explore how to the modification of non-graphical argument for survival plots (i.e., font size/family, etc.).

## (3). Version 3: Modification of non-graphical components

In here, we first introduce a self create function for modifying non-graphical components and this self defined function **uses `ggplot2` arguments**.

```{r}
# Customize theme
Customized.Theme <- function(){
  theme_survminer() %+replace%                                        # a ggplot2 function 
    theme(panel.border = element_blank(),
          panel.background = element_blank(),                    
          panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
          panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), 
          axis.line.x = element_line(),                               # these two are for the axis line
          axis.line.y = element_line(),
          axis.text.x = element_text(family = 'Times', colour = "black", size = 11),    # there two are for texts in axes
          axis.text.y = element_text(family = 'Times', colour = "black", size = 11),
          axis.ticks.x = element_line(),                              # these two are for ticks in axes
          axis.ticks.y = element_line(),
          axis.title.x = element_text(family = 'Times', colour = "black", size = 11, face = 'bold', vjust = -1),                              
          axis.title.y = element_text(family = 'Times', colour = "black", size = 11, face = 'bold', angle = 90, vjust = 3),
          legend.title = element_text(family = 'Times', colour = "black", size = 11, face = 'bold'),
          legend.text = element_text(family = 'Times', colour = "black", size = 11),
          strip.text.x = element_text(family = 'Times', colour = "black", size = 11))
}
```

In the `Customized.Theme()` function, we set the font family for text as "Times" and size as 11 for axes, legends, and labels. Meanwhile, we remove the background and grid and use self defined color/palette for different cancer `Stage` as usual.

```{r}
# Color/palette for cancer stage
Legend.Labs <- c('Stage I', 'Stage II', 'Stage III', 'Stage IV')            # create labels for cancer stages
n.color <- length(Legend.Labs)                                              # the lenght of vector for labels
Palette.New <- rainbow(n.color, alpha = 0.5)                                # obtain a vector of colors for labels

# Kaplan-Meier estimator
KM2 <- survfit(Surv(Time, Status) ~ Stage + Treatment, data = Dt.Plot)    

# Survival plot
ggsurvplot(KM2, data = Dt.Plot, 
           facet.by = 'Treatment',                                          # create multipanel used variable "Treatment"
           pval = TRUE, 
           legend = 'right',                                                # legend position
           legend.labs = Legend.Labs,                                       # self-defined legend label
           palette = Palette.New,                                           # self-defined color
           xlab = 'Time (Month)', ylab = 'Survival Probability',            # modify X-axis and Y-axis labels
           ggtheme = Customized.Theme())                                    # use modified non-graphical components
```

Here we go! For other non-graphical components, we can change them in the `Customized.Theme()` and follow arguments in `ggplot2`.
