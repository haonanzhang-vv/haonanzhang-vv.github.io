In this tutorial, we will explore how to create __plots for the cumulative incidence function__ in R using `ggplot2`, `survminer`, and `tidycmprsk`. The cumulative incidence function (CIF) is frequently used in survival analysis when __competing risks__ are present in the dataset. In traditional survival data, the survival label $\delta$ only has two classes: 0 or 1 (often referred to as alive or deceased). However, in the presence of competing risks, the survival outcome may involve more than two states, such as 0, 1, or 2 (often referred to as healthy, progressing, or deceased).

# 1. Format of dataset
We will be using the monoclonal gammopathy data from the `survival` package, which consists of the natural history of 1341 sequential patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (__MGUS__). This dataset involves survival outcomes with three possible states: __censored, progression to plasma cell malignancy disease (PCM), and death due to MGUS__. After data preprocessing, there are 7 columns in the dataset:

- `Sex`: this is a variable for sex __[2 levels (factor): "Female" and "Male"]__ (string);

- `Status`: this is a combined event variable for three states __[3 levels (factor): "Censor", "Plasma Cell Malignancy", "Death"] (string)__;

- `Time`: this is a __combined survival time (year)__ until any event happened or censored (numerical);

- `PCM`: this is an event indicator for whether a patient progressed to PCM __[2 levels (factor): "No", "Yes"] (string)__;

- `PCM_Time`: this is a __survival time (year)__ until the `PCM` event happened or censored (numerical);

- `Death`: this is an event indicator for whether a patient died __[2 levels (factor): "No", "Yes"] (string)__;

- `Death_Time`: this is a __survival time (year)__ until the `Death` event happened or censored (numerical).

# 2. Cumulative incidence function plot
## (1). Cumulative incidence function
Before creating a figure, we need to construct a model for the cumulative incidence function in order to __examine the differences in survival among the three states, stratified by the sex of the patients__ and we need to use `cuminc()` function from the `tidycmprsk` package to build a CIF model. 

```{r}
# Cumulative incidence functioin
require(tidycmprsk)
CIF <- cuminc(Surv(Time, Status) ~ Sex, data = Dt.Plot)
```

`cuminc()` function requires two main arguments: 

- `formula`: it should be a `Surv()` on LHS and covariates on RHS;

- `data`: it is the dataset used to estimate cumulative incidence.

After we fitted a cumulative incidence function, we can pass it into functions for creating figures.

## (2). Customized theme
To more effectively __customize non-graphical components__ in `ggplot2` for survival data, it is recommended to create a function that allows for theme customization.

```{r}
# Customize theme of kaplan meier curve
Customized.Theme <- function(){
  theme_survminer() %+replace%                                        # a ggplot2 function 
    theme(panel.border = element_blank(),
          panel.background = element_blank(),                    
          panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
          panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), 
          axis.line.x = element_line(),                               # these two are for the axis line
          axis.line.y = element_line(),
          axis.text.x = element_text(size = 11),                      # there two are for texts in axes
          axis.text.y = element_text(size = 11),
          axis.ticks.x = element_line(),                              # these two are for ticks in axes
          axis.ticks.y = element_line(),
          axis.title.x = element_text(size = 11, face = 'bold', vjust = -1),                              
          axis.title.y = element_text(size = 11, face = 'bold', angle = 90, vjust = 3),
          legend.title = element_text(size = 11, face = 'bold'),
          legend.text = element_text(size = 11),
          legend.position = 'right',
          plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
}
```

In the `Customized.Theme()` function, we set the font weight to bold and font size to 11 for the x-axis label, y-axis label, and main title. Additionally, we remove the background and grid lines.

## (3). Plot
Now, we will create a figure to visualize the cumulative incidence function (`CIF`). To do this, we will use the `ggcuminc()` function from the `ggsurvfit` package, which requires three arguments: 

- `x`: this argument represents a cumulative incidence function model from either `cuminc()` or `survfit2()`;

- `outcome`: this is an argument for indicating which outcome(s) to include in plot and default is to include the first competing event;

- `theme`: this is an argument for a `survfit` theme and default is `theme_ggsurvfit_default()`.

```{r}
# Create title and outcome
Title <- paste0('Cumulative Incidence of Death from \n MGUS or Progression to PCM Stratified by ', 'Sex')
Oucome <- c("Plasma Cell Malignancy", "Death")

# Create CIF plot
CIF_Plot <- ggcuminc(x = CIF,                        # the above CIF function
                     outcome = Oucome,               # the label for competing events
                     theme = Customized.Theme()) +   # customize theme
  labs(x = 'Time (Years Post Diagnosis)',            # modify xlab, ylab, and main title
       y = 'Cumulative Incidence', 
       title = Title)
CIF_Plot
```

Here we go!

## (4). Comparison between Kaplan-Meier curve
In contrast to the cumulative incidence function, the __Kaplan-Meier curve__ estimates the failure rate for each competing event separately. When the event of interest is __progression to PCM__, the __death due to MGUS__ will be considered as censored events, in addition to the usual censored observations. __On the other hand, the cumulative incidence function uses the overall survival function, which takes into account events from both the competing events and the events of interest__.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YzwIsALaity/CIF-Plot-in-R/main/Comparison%20of%20Curves.jpeg)

It is clear that the Kaplan-Meier curve for progression to PCM treats events that are due to death as censored at later years post-diagnosis, which cannot be accurately represented. However, this situation can be visualized using the cumulative incidence function.
