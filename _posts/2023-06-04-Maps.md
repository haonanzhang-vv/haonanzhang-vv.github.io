In this tutorial, I will be demonstrating how to __plot geographical information in R using the__ `ggplot2` __package__. In addition to the core package, we will also need to load `ggthemes`, `ggrepel`, and `tigris` for visualization, labeling, and text on maps. Generally, __a 2D map is represented using a latitude and longitude coordinate system, with longitude typically placed on the x-axis and latitude on the y-axis__. For this tutorial, we will utilize two COVID-19 surveillance datasets obtained from the [SCAN program](https://seattleflu.org/history/scandashboards) in King County, Washington and the [Washington Department of Health](https://doh.wa.gov/emergencies/covid-19/data-dashboard). In the `ggplot2` package, map visualization primarily involves two types of functions: `geom_polygon()` for __plotting polygons__ and `geom_sf()` for __plotting simple feature (sf) objects__, which are commonly used for mapping data with latitude and longitude coordinates. First, we will cover the usage of `geom_polygon()`, followed by an exploration of `geom_sf()`.

# 1. Polygon Version
## (1). Data preprocessing
We used a dataset to plot the polygon version, which contains records of COVID-19 cases confirmed by PCR tests in Washington state, and is aggregated at the county level, pertaining to the year 2021. It can be accessed through the website for [Washington Department of Health](https://doh.wa.gov/emergencies/covid-19/data-dashboard). The dataset is very simple and only includes two columns:

- `County`: a categorical __list of counties__ in the Washington state __[39 unique counties]__ (string);

- `Frequency`: a numerical frequency of confirmed COVID-19 cases for each county (numerical).

To obtain geographical information such as latitude and longitude coordinates for each county in Washington state, we needed to extract this data since it was not originally included in the dataset.

The `ggplot2` provides a convenient function `map_data()` that easily turns data from the `maps` package into a data frame suitable for plotting with `ggplot2`, and it mainly requires two arguments:

- `map`: name of map provided by the `maps` package. These include `maps::county()`, `maps::france()`, `maps::italy()`, `maps::nz()`, `maps::state()`, `maps::usa()`, `maps::world()`, `maps::world2()`;

- `region`: name(s) of subregion(s) to include. Defaults to `.` which includes all subregions.

In `Map_WA` dataframe, it includes three columns: 

- `lon` and `lat`: the numerical latitude and longitude coordinates (numerical);

- `id`: the name of counties (string).

```{r}
# Obtain a map for the Washington state and it is in county level 
Map_WA <- map_data(map = 'county', region =  'washington') %>% select(lon = long, lat, id = subregion) 
head(Map_WA)
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YzwIsALaity/Map-Tutorial-in-R/ded9575dbb1358e79cafd249af654759aabadd01/map_data%20Dataset.png)

To __plot each county in this dataframe as a polygon__, we assign multiple pairs of latitude and longitude coordinates to describe the county's boundary. By using the `geom_polygon()` function, we can connect these coordinate pairs to create the polygon representation. To maintain consistency with the `Dt` dataframe, it is necessary to change the column name from `id` to `County` for the `Map_WA` dataframe and capitalize the name of each county. We can achieve this by utilizing the `str_to_title()` function from the `stringr` package. Once these modifications are made, we will merge the dataset for COVID-19 frequency and `Map_WA` dataframes to obtain the final dataframe `Dt_Plot` for generating figures. In the first plot, we aim to __highlight the top three counties with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in 2021, namely King, Pierce, and Snohomish counties__. Additionally, we intend to __mark four major cities (Seattle, Bellevue, Kirkland, and Redmond) within King county as points on the map through latitude and longitude coordinates__ since there are lots of software engineers lol.

```{r}
# Convert first letter of every word to uppercase
require(stringr)
Map_WA$id <- str_to_title(Map_WA$id)

# Change "id" to "County"
colnames(Map_WA)[3] <- 'County'

# Join geographical data with COVID-19 data
Dt_Plot <- left_join(Map_WA, Dt, by = 'County')

# Highlight counties with confirmed cases > 50000
HighlightCounty <- Dt_Plot[which(Dt_Plot$County %in% c('King', 'Pierce', 'Snohomish')), ]

# Mark location of Seattle, Bellevue, Kirkland with 
PointedCity <- data.frame('City' = c('Seattle', 'Bellevue', 'Kirkland', 'Redmond'), 
                          'lon' = c(-122.335167, -122.200676, -122.20715, -122.121513), 
                          'lat' = c(47.608013, 47.610378, 47.676607, 47.673988))
```

After completing the data preprocessing, we are now moving forward with the creation of a map to visualize the total number of COVID-19 cases in Washington state at the county level.

## (2). Figure 1: Polygon
As we mentioned above, __a 2D map is represented using a latitude and longitude coordinate system, with longitude typically placed on the x-axis and latitude on the y-axis__. To create a better 2D map, we need to take care of procedures below:

- Based on the `Dt_Plot` dataframe, our primary implementation involves using the `geom_polygon()` function. This function __connects all the points used to describe a polygon, and the interior of the polygon is colored based on the `fill` argument__. Since our goal is to visualize the frequency of COVID-19 cases, we will __set `fill = Frequency` to create a continuous scale of colors ranging from light to dark__. This will effectively __represent the magnitude of case counts__. __The `group` argument determines which points are connected to form a polygon__. In our case, we __treat each county as a unique group__, so we will set `group = County`. __The `coord_sf()` is used to ensures that all layers use a common Coordinate Reference Systems which is used to define, with the help of coordinates, how the two-dimensional, projected map is related to real locations on the earth__.

- To __visualize selected counties with different colored boundaries__, we can __pass the `HighlightCounty` dataframe into an additional `geom_polygon()` function alongside the main one__. Since our goal is to highlight the boundaries without affecting the visualization of the COVID-19 case frequencies, __there is no need to `fill` in any colors. We can achieve this by setting `fill = NA`__.

- To __visualized selected cities with points__, we can __pass the `PointedCity` dataframe into the `geom_point()` function where x and y axes are longitude and latitude__. Since these __cities are all in King county__, we need to __set `group = 'King'` to match the main `geom_polygon()` function__. To __label these cities__, we need to __use the `geom_text_repel()` function from the `ggrepel` package. The details of using this function can be found in my show case for__ [Pie Chart in R](https://yzwisalaity.github.io/Pie-Chart/).

- For different color gradient, we will use the `scale_fill_gradient2_tableau()` function from the `ggthemes` package. We also change the legend title for continuous color scale with the `guide_colorbar()` function. We also remove x and y axes in displaying the figure.  

Now we are going to combine them together to get a 2D map!

```{r}
require(ggrepel)
require(ggthemes)

Now we can visualize the overall frequency of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Washington state at the county level with a 2D map!

# 2. Simple Feature (sf) Version
## (1). Data preprocessing
Unlike the use of polygons to represent a 2D map, the concept of simple feature (sf) pertains to a formal standard that outlines how real-world objects can be accurately represented in computers, with particular focus on the spatial geometry of these objects. Consequently, geographical information such as latitude and longitude coordinates are commonly stored as `sf` objects. For additional details about `sf` objects, you can refer to the documentation provided in the [`sf` package](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html). To illustrate how we can use `sf` object to visualize maps in R, we plan to use the COVID-19 survelliance data from the [SCAN program](https://seattleflu.org/history/scandashboards) in King County, Washington. As we noticed in the previous section, King county had the biggest amount of overall confirmed COVID-19 cases in 2021, we then want to investigate how this number was distributed in cities belonged to King County. The SCAN program provide a comprehensive record of COVID-19 cases. 

To demonstrate the utilization of `sf` objects for visualizing maps in R, our plan is to utilize the COVID-19 surveillance data obtained from the [SCAN program](https://seattleflu.org/history/scandashboards) in King County, Washington. As highlighted in the preceding section, King County had the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in 2021. Therefore, our objective is to explore the distribution of these cases across cities within King County. The SCAN program offers a comprehensive record of COVID-19 cases and one of its public dataset categorized by zip codes has 8 columns:

- `geo_id`: a character list of zip codes for cities in King County (string);

- `Population`: the number of population in each city (numerical);

- `Frequency`: a numerical frequency of confirmed COVID-19 cases for each city (numerical);

- `lat` and `lon`: the numerical latitude and longitude coordinates (numerical);

- `City` and `State`: the name of city and state (string).

It is important to note that each city may encompass multiple zip codes, and the latitude and longitude coordinates provided for a zip code only represent its center point. Therefore, the complete shape of each zip code area cannot be accurately described by a limited set of latitude and longitude coordinates, and we need to obtain a better record to describe each zip code area. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YzwIsALaity/Map-Tutorial-in-R/ded9575dbb1358e79cafd249af654759aabadd01/Second%20Covid%20Dataset.png)

In order to obtain comprehensive geographical information for each zip code area, we can utilize the `zctas()` function provided by the `tigris` package. This function requires the specification of several arguments:

- `cb`: if cb is set to TRUE, download a generalized (1:500k) ZCTA file. Defaults to FALSE (the most detailed TIGER/Line file). If `cb = TRUE`, a small zip code dataset will be downloaded, and if `cb = FALSE`, a large full  dataset will be downloaded;

- `starts_with`: character vector specifying the beginning digits of the ZCTAs you want to return;

- `year`: the data year;

- `class`: desired class of return object.

```{r}
require(tigris)
Zip <- zctas(cb = T, starts_with = c("98"), year = 2020, class = "sf")
Zip
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YzwIsALaity/Map-Tutorial-in-R/ded9575dbb1358e79cafd249af654759aabadd01/Zip%20Code.png)

Our objective is to extract two specific columns from the data: `ZCTA5CE20` (5-Digit ZIP Code Tabulation Area) and `geometry` (as an sf object) for the purpose of plotting a 2D map. Once we have retrieved these columns, we will merge them with the COVID-19 surveillance dataset. Additionally, we intend to emphasize the boundaries of four cities (Seattle, Bellevue, Kirkland, Redmond) by assigning them distinct colors.

```{r}
Zip <- as.data.frame(Zip)                  # Change the dataset to dataframe
Zip <- Zip[, c('ZCTA5CE20', 'geometry')]   # Obtain zip code and sf object columns
colnames(Zip)[1] <- 'geo_id'               # Change the column name for zip code 

Dt_Plot <- left_join(Dt, Zip, by = 'geo_id') # Left join 

# Highlight cities
HighlightCity <- Dt_Plot[which(Dt_Plot$City %in% c('Seattle', 'Bellevue', 'Kirkland', 'Redmond')), ]
```

## (2). Figure 2: sf
After obtaining the `Dt_Plot` dataframe for creating a figure, we will utilize the `ggplot()` function. __The primary component we will utilize is `geom_sf()`, which renders different geometric objects based on the presence of sf objects in the data__. __The colors for the interior and exterior of a polygon (i.e., zip code area) are controlled by the `fill` and `col` arguments within the `aes()` function. In the first `geom_sf()` function, we set `fill = Frequency` to represent a gradient color scale based on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. In the second `geom_sf()` function, we set `col = City` to assign distinct colors to selected cities. However, we do not want to modify the color of the polygon's interior, so we pass `fill = NA` outside the `aes()` function in the second `geom_sf()`. It is important to note that we must specify `mapping = aes()` in the second `geom_sf()` function to avoid encountering an error__.

```{r}
# Figure ###################################################################################################
p1 <- 
  ggplot(Dt_Plot) + 
  geom_sf(aes(fill = Frequency, 
              geometry = geometry), 
          alpha = 0.7) + 
  geom_sf(HighlightCity, 
          mapping = aes(geometry = geometry, col = City), 
          linewidth = 0.6, 
          fill = NA) + 
  scale_fill_gradient2_tableau(palette = 'Gold-Purple Diverging') + 
  theme_bw() + 
  guides(fill = guide_colourbar(title = c("COVID-19 Cases"))) + 
  ggtitle('Overall Confirmed COVID-19 Cases in \nKing County, WA up to May 24, 2023') + 
  theme(panel.border = element_blank(),   
        panel.grid = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(), 
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),                              
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),                  
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),                              
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        legend.title = element_text(color = 'black', face = 'bold'),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = 'bold'))
