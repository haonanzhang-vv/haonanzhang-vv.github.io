In this tutorial, we'll introduce the use of __ridgeline plots__ in R using the __`ggplot2` and `ggridges` packages__. These plots display a sequence of histogram or density plots stacked vertically, making it a useful tool for __visualizing changes in the distribution of a numerical variable across different time points or categories__.

## 1. Dataset
We will use a simulated dataset for this visualization. Suppose there is a 3-year cohort consisting of 200 participants who initially contracted severe Covid-19 at enrollment. We collected cytokine data at 0, 30, 90, 180, 360, 540, and 720 days (7 time points). Additionally, we hypothesized that the __TNF-alpha cytokine__ levels (pg/mL) would increase during the initial 90 days and then gradually decrease as the acute symptoms subsided. The ridgeline plot is an excellent tool for __visualizing longitudinal changes in TNF-alpha__ data. The dataset is very simple and includes 4 variables only:

- `PTID`: this is an __unique identification__ for each participants __[200 participants]__ (string);

- `Time`: this variable represents the __time point of sample collection__ (numerical);

- `TNF_alpha`: this variable represents the __value of TNF-alpha cytokine__ in pg/mL (numerical);

- `Numerical_PTID`: This is equivalent to `PTID`, but it is represented numerically (numerical).

At each time point, we collected 200 observations of TNF-alpha cytokine values in pg/mL. Since we hypothesize that this cytokine is linked to pro-inflammatory processes, monitoring its values can serve as a key indicator of inflammation. We aim to investigate whether inflammatory symptoms gradually decrease after the acute period.

## 2. Ridgeline plot
The ridgeline plot is generated using the `ggridges` extension package for `ggplot2.` We primarily employ three functions: `geom_ridgeline()`, `geom_density_ridges()`, and `geom_density_ridges_gradient()`, to create various types of ridgeline plots. In the basic version, we will cover the usage of `geom_ridgeline()` and `geom_density_ridges()`, while the comprehensive version will include a detailed walkthrough of `geom_density_ridges_gradient()`.

### (1). Basic version
In the basic version, we will begin by introducing two functions: `geom_ridgeline()` and `geom_density_ridges()`. These functions are used for visualizing the raw ridgeline of a numerical variable and the density of a numerical variable, respectively. The `geom_ridgeline()` function is utilized to create lines with filled areas beneath them, and it necessitates certain arguments:

- `height`: it is used to __define the height of the ridgeline__, measured from the corresponding `y` value, where `y` is regarded as a grouping or categorical variable for stratification. It needs to be passed into `aes()` in `geom_ridgeline()`.

- `scale`: it acts as a scaling factor to __adjust the height of the ridgelines__. A __higher value indicates a larger scaling of height__ relative to the height of each group.

- `rel_min_height`: it is used to __set a percentage cutoff in relation to the highest point of any density curve__. A __smaller value signifies a more extended tail on both sides of the density curve__.

__Quantiles__ can be highlighted using the following arguments:

- `quantile_lines`: it is a binary logical argument, which can be set to either `TRUE` or `FALSE.` By default, it is set to `FALSE`, and setting it to `TRUE` will result in the quantile line being displayed in the area under the curve/line.

- `quantiles`: it is used to define a vector of quantiles (i.e., 0.25, 0.5, etc.) 

__Jittered points__ (added a small amount of random variation to the location of each point) can be showed using the following arguments:

- `jittered_points`: it is a binary logical argument, which can be set to either `TRUE` or `FALSE.` By default, it is set to `FALSE`, and setting it to `TRUE` will result in visualizing jittered points.

- `position`: it is a string argument used to set up position of jittered points in a ridgeline plot.

  + `position = "points_jitter"`: jittered points are randomly shifted up and down and/or left and right.
  
  + `position = "points_sina"`: jittered points are randomly distributed to fill the entire shaded area representing the data density.
  
  + `position = "raincloud"`: jittered points lie all underneath the baseline of each individual ridgeline.
  
In addition to the arguments within `geom_ridgeline()` and `geom_density_ridges()`, the package also offers a function for customizing the theme using `theme_ridges()`. By default, it does not center labels on the x and y axes, so you can use the `center_axis_labels = TRUE` argument to center the axis labels.

```{r}
require(ggplot2)
require(ggthemes)
require(ggridges)

# Basic ridgeline
p1 <- 
ggplot(Dt, aes(x = Numerical_PTID, 
               y = Time)) + 
  geom_ridgeline(aes(height = TNF_alpha),
                 scale = 0.001,  
                 fill = "lightblue") + 
  ggtitle('Basic ridgeline') +

  scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0, 0)) + 
  theme_ridges(center_axis_labels = TRUE)

ggplot(Dt, aes(x = TNF_alpha, y = Time)) + 
  geom_density_ridges(scale = 5, 
                      rel_min_height = 0.001, 
                      fill = "lightblue", 
                      quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75),

p3 <- 
ggplot(Dt, aes(x = TNF_alpha, y = Time)) + 
  geom_density_ridges(scale = 5, 
                      rel_min_height = 0.0001, 
                      fill="lightblue", 
                      jittered_points = TRUE, 
                      position = "raincloud") + 
  ggtitle('Density ridgeline with jittered points') + 
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) + 
  scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0, 0)) + 
  theme_ridges(center_axis_labels = TRUE)

# Ridgeline in binline version
p4 <- 
ggplot(Dt, aes(x = TNF_alpha, y = Time)) + 
  geom_density_ridges(stat = "binline", 
                      scale = 3, 
                      rel_min_height = 0.0001, 
                      fill="lightblue") +
  ggtitle('Ridgeline in bins') + 
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) + 
  scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0, 0)) + 
  theme_ridges(center_axis_labels = TRUE)

grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
```

In the __Basic ridgeline__ plot (top left), `geom_ridgeline()` simply maps TNF-alpha values at each time point according to numerical patient IDs. In contrast, the __Density ridgeline__ plot (top right) and the __Density ridgeline with jitter points__ plot (bottom left) offer more informative visuals, displaying the density of TNF-alpha value distributions grouped by time points. If users prefer a binned version (histogram), they can opt for the __Ridgeline in bins__ plot (bottom right).

### (2). Comprehensive version
For a more enhanced visualization of the TNF-alpha value distribution density, you can employ the `geom_density_ridges_gradient()` function, which __displays gradient colors under the density curve__ for each time point. To achieve this, you need to utilize the `after_stat(x)` function within the `aes()` function of the main `ggplot()` function. This allows you to map the transformed TNF-alpha values from `x` to the `fill` argument.

```{r}
# Texts for y axis
yText <- c('At enrollment', paste0(c(30, 90, 180, 360, 540, 720), '-day'))

p5 <- 
ggplot(data = Dt, aes(x = TNF_alpha,             # x-axis: value of TNF-alpha
                      y = Time,                  # y-axis: time point
                      fill = after_stat(x))) +

                   label = yText) + 
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) + 
  labs(x = expression("Mean TNF"*alpha ~ '(pg/mL)'),          # x-axis label
       fill = expression("TNF"*alpha ~ '(pg/mL)'),            # legend title
       title = expression('Density of' ~ "TNF"*alpha ~ '(pg/mL) at Different Time Points')) +     
  theme_bw() +

        axis.title.x = element_text(colour = "black", vjust = -1),

        legend.title = element_text(colour = "black"),
        legend.text = element_text(colour = "black"),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

In this figure, we have eliminated all extraneous elements and focused solely on highlighting the density curve for TNF-alpha values. The intensity of TNF-alpha is represented by a gradient color scale.

__The inspiration for the ridgeline plot design comes from the cover of the debut studio album by the rock band Joy Division, and we can also experiment with mimicking that cover.__
